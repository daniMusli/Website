          I was born in a city called Aleppo located near the northern Syrian border. Aleppo is regarded as one of the oldest inhabited cities in the world dating back 
            to 12000 BCE.

            I started attending the American college for boys at the age of 12. I finished my middle school and high school there.
            Right around a young age, I had my mind set on becoming a computer engineer. It was always cool to be the kid who fixes laptops, download games and music 
            to phones XD, help the family around with their simple technology demands. I used to sit for hours going through the dial-up internet connection we had 
            back then to search new games, new music and cool knowledge; like how old retro games are made. In high school I had a huge interest in games and animes, 
            that was when I created my first form to share some content and fan made translations and arts.

           I started my University life at Aleppo University, Computer Science department around 2012. I was young, full of energy and passion eager to discover more 
            about the techonlogy world. Right around that time, the Syrian revolution started taking a new turn as more and more cities became more involved. As one can
            expect, it became very hard to sustain an academic life.

           As I finished 2 years in my pursue for a bachelor's degree at the University of Aleppo, the Syrian crisis turned into a full-fledged war. 
           As much as it pained me to leave, I had to try and pursue another path to carry on. I was granted a full scholarship through the YTP 
           Turkish Scholarship program to study Computer Science at Ataturk University. I had many hardships and lots and lots of great memories.
           It was challenging and fun to learn a new language from scratch and adapt new life and culture.

           My undergrad life experience came to an end in 2019. I graduate second in my class. I had a lot of fun, made a lot of unbreakable bonds and learned 
            a lot about computer architecture, data structures and algorithms, web and app development, microprocessors and embedded systems and my favorite subjects; 
            computer vision and machine learning. Perhaps my highlight moment for my undergraduate life in Erzurum, Turkey is that I met the love of my life there.

            As part of our university requirements, I took my internship at "Erzurum Buyuksehir Belediyesi". I was admitted with a team of students. It was a fun experiment 
            and we learned a lot.

            I started pursuing a MsC in Electrical and Computer Engineering department at the University of Oklahoma. During my masters time I was also working as a
            graduate research assistant. I worked on developing several Intelligent Transportation Systems for the Oklahoma Department of Transportation. I also 
            conducted research on muscle activation in collaboration with the OU Health and Science Center.
